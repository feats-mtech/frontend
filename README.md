# fEATs frontend

fEATs is a platform for tracking your ingredients and their expiry dates. You can also add, publish and share your recipes with other people.

This repository hosts the frontend code of fEATs. The frontend is implemented in ReactJS.

### Getting Started

1. Ensure node is installed on your machine
2. Install Prettier extension on VSCode
3. Ensure that your backend is also running along with the database for the frontend to interact with the backend

### Commands

#### npm

`npm i` - install project dependencies  
`npm run prepare` to setup husky (one-time setup)  
`npm run dev` - start application locally on localhost:3000

#### Docker

```sh
# build a docker container named feats-frontend with the latest tag
docker build -t feats-frontend .

# run the docker container on port 3000
docker run -d -p 3000:80 feats-frontend
```

### Running Tests

Run unit tests by running the following command:
`npm run test`

### Commit Message Guidelines

`husky` is used as a commit linting tool to check and enforce a [commit message guideline](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

Get husky setup by running `npm run prepare`.

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Example:

```
feat: add user login page
```

## Continuous Integration

The project is using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

Refer to `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for the detailed steps in the CI pipeline.

The following diagram illustrates the overview of the CI workflow:

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is done using [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The CI pipeline will end with updating the application's image version onto the kubernetes yaml file found in the [deployment repo](https://github.com/dmss-group3-practice-module/deployment). There will be an ArgoCD agent in the kubernetes cluster on hosted on DigitalOcean which listens to version changes in the `deployment` repository.
